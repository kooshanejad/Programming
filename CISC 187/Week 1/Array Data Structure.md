# Array Data Structure Lab
1. 
```cpp
int arr[100];
```
In this line of code, "int" means that the data type for the array is integers. "arr" is the name of the array, and 100 is the number of elements in the array.  
2. 
```cpp
sizeof(int)
``` 
For an array containing 100 elements, provide the number of steps the following operations would take: (theoretical) - 6 pts  
Reading  
Searching for a value not contained within the array  
Insertion at the beginning of the array  
Insertion at the end of the array  
Deletion at the beginning of the array  
Deletion at the end of the array  
Normally the search operation in an array looks for the first instance of a given value. But sometimes we may want to look for every instance of a given value. For example, say we want to count how many times the value “apple” is found inside an array. How many steps would it take to find all the “apples”? Give your answer in terms of N. (theoretical) - 1 pts  
Research how to find the memory address of an array. You can use any programming language of your choice. (requires code) 1 pts
