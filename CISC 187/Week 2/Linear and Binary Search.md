# Linear and Binary Search Lab

1. To perform a linear search for the number 8 in the ordered array, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13], it would take four steps.
2. For the previous example, binary search would take one step.
3. The maximum number of steps it would take to perform a binary search on an array of size 100,000 is 17. You get this answer by calculating log base 2 of 100,000, which gives you 16.6, and you round to 17 because the number of steps must be a whole number.
