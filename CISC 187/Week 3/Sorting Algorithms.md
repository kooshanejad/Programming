1. In Big O Notation, we ignore constant coefficients and constant terms because they do not significantly affect growth as N becomes large. The dominant term here is 4N, and removing the constant multiplier gives N. Therefore, the time complexity of an algorithm that takes 4N + 16 steps is O(N).
2. Again, in Big O Notation, we ignore constant coefficients. The dominant term here is N^2, and the constant 2 does not change the growth rate. Thus, the time complexity of an algorithm that takes 2N^2 steps is O(N^2).
3. This function loops through the array once to double each number and store it in a new array. That first loop runs N times, then it loops through the new array to compute the sum, which also runs N times. The total work is N + N = 2N; dropping the constant 2, the time complexity is O(N).
4. This function loops through the array once. For each string, it performs three constant-time operations: upcase, downcase, and capitalize, and prints each result. Since these are constant-time operations relative to the number of elements in the array, each iteration is constant work. The loop runs N times, so the overall time complexity is O(N).
5. This function first loops through the entire array, which takes N steps. For each element whose index is even, it runs a second loop over the entire array. Since that inner loop runs N times and is triggered about N/2 times, the total work is approximately N/2 * N, which simplifies to (N^2)/2. Dropping constants, the overall time complexity is O(N^2).
